cargo-llvm-cov
Cargo subcommand to easily use LLVM source-based code coverage (-C instrument-coverage).

USAGE:
    cargo llvm-cov [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS] [-- <args>...]

ARGS:
    <args>...
            Arguments for the test binary

OPTIONS:
        --json
            Export coverage data in "json" format

            If --output-path is not specified, the report will be printed to stdout.

            This internally calls `llvm-cov export -format=text`. See
            <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html#llvm-cov-export> for more.

        --lcov
            Export coverage data in "lcov" format

            If --output-path is not specified, the report will be printed to stdout.

            This internally calls `llvm-cov export -format=lcov`. See
            <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html#llvm-cov-export> for more.

        --cobertura
            Export coverage data in "cobertura" XML format

            If --output-path is not specified, the report will be printed to stdout.

            This internally calls `llvm-cov export -format=lcov` and then converts to cobertura.xml.
            See <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html#llvm-cov-export> for more.

        --codecov
            Export coverage data in "Codecov Custom Coverage" format

            If --output-path is not specified, the report will be printed to stdout.

            This internally calls `llvm-cov export -format=json` and then converts to codecov.json.
            See <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html#llvm-cov-export> for more.

        --text
            Generate coverage report in “text” format

            If --output-path or --output-dir is not specified, the report will be printed to stdout.

            This internally calls `llvm-cov show -format=text`. See
            <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html#llvm-cov-show> for more.

        --html
            Generate coverage report in "html" format

            If --output-dir is not specified, the report will be generated in `target/llvm-cov/html`
            directory.

            This internally calls `llvm-cov show -format=html`. See
            <https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html#llvm-cov-show> for more.

        --open
            Generate coverage reports in "html" format and open them in a browser after the
            operation.

            See --html for more.

        --summary-only
            Export only summary information for each file in the coverage data

            This flag can only be used together with --json, --lcov, or --cobertura.

        --output-path <PATH>
            Specify a file to write coverage data into.

            This flag can only be used together with --json, --lcov, --cobertura, or --text.
            See --output-dir for --html and --open.

        --output-dir <DIRECTORY>
            Specify a directory to write coverage report into (default to `target/llvm-cov`).

            This flag can only be used together with --text, --html, or --open. See also
            --output-path.

        --failure-mode <any|all>
            Fail if `any` or `all` profiles cannot be merged (default to `any`)

        --ignore-filename-regex <PATTERN>

    -p, --package <SPEC>
            Package to run tests for

        --workspace
            Test all packages in the workspace

        --all
            Alias for --workspace (deprecated)

        --exclude <SPEC>
            Exclude packages from both the test and report

        --exclude-from-test <SPEC>
            Exclude packages from the test (but not from the report)

        --exclude-from-report <SPEC>
            Exclude packages from the report (but not from the test)

    -j, --jobs <N>
            Number of parallel jobs, defaults to # of CPUs

    -r, --release
            Build artifacts in release mode, with optimizations

        --profile <PROFILE-NAME>
            Build artifacts with the specified profile

    -F, --features <FEATURES>
            Space or comma separated list of features to activate

        --all-features
            Activate all available features

            Do not activate the `default` feature

        --target <TRIPLE>
            Build for the target triple

            When this option is used, coverage for proc-macro and build script will not be displayed
            because cargo does not pass RUSTFLAGS to them.

        --coverage-target-only
            Activate coverage reporting only for the target triple

            Activate coverage reporting only for the target triple specified via `--target`. This is
            important, if the project uses multiple targets via the cargo bindeps feature, and not
            all targets can use `instrument-coverage`, e.g. a microkernel, or an embedded binary.

    -v, --verbose
            Use verbose output

            Use -vv (-vvv) to propagate verbosity to cargo.

        --color <WHEN>
            Coloring: auto, always, never

        --remap-path-prefix
            Use --remap-path-prefix for workspace root

            Note that this does not fully compatible with doctest.

        --include-ffi
            Include coverage of C/C++ code linked to Rust library/binary

            Note that `CC`/`CXX`/`LLVM_COV`/`LLVM_PROFDATA` environment variables must be set to
            Clang/LLVM compatible with the LLVM version used in rustc.

        --keep-going
            Do not abort the build as soon as there is an error (unstable)

        --ignore-rust-version
            Ignore `rust-version` specification in packages

        --manifest-path <PATH>
            Path to Cargo.toml

        --frozen
            Require Cargo.lock and cache are up to date

            Require Cargo.lock is up to date

        --offline
            Run without accessing the network

    -Z <FLAG>
            Unstable (nightly-only) flags to Cargo, see 'cargo -Z help' for

            Print help information

    -V, --version
            Print version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    test
            Run tests and generate coverage report
            This is equivalent to `cargo llvm-cov` without subcommand,
            except that test name filtering is supported.
    run
            Run a binary or example and generate coverage report
    report
            Generate coverage report
    show-env
            Output the environment set by cargo-llvm-cov to build Rust projects
    clean
            Remove artifacts that cargo-llvm-cov has generated in the past
    nextest
            Run tests with cargo nextest
            This internally calls `cargo nextest run`.
