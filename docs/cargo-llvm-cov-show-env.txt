cargo-llvm-cov-show-env
Output the environment set by cargo-llvm-cov to build Rust projects

USAGE:
    cargo llvm-cov show-env [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
        --sh, --export-prefix
            Make output suitable to be sourced by POSIX sh, Bash, and Zsh

        --pwsh, --with-pwsh-env-prefix
            Make output suitable to be used with Invoke-Expression in PowerShell 6+

        --cmd
            Make output suitable to be called by cmd.exe

        --csh
            Make output suitable to be sourced by csh and tcsh

        --fish
            Make output suitable to be sourced by fish

        --nu
            Make output suitable to be sourced by nushell

        --doctests
            Including doc tests (unstable)

            This flag is unstable. See <https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov/issues/2> for
            more.

        --target <TRIPLE>
            Build for the target triple

        --coverage-target-only
            Activate coverage reporting only for the target triple

            Activate coverage reporting only for the target triple specified via `--target`. This is
            important, if the project uses multiple targets via the cargo bindeps feature, and not
            all targets can use `instrument-coverage`, e.g. a microkernel, or an embedded binary.

            When this flag is used, coverage for proc-macro and build script will not be displayed.

        --remap-path-prefix
            Use --remap-path-prefix for workspace root

            Note that this does not fully compatible with doctest.

        --include-ffi
            Include coverage of C/C++ code linked to Rust library/binary

            Note that `CC`/`CXX`/`LLVM_COV`/`LLVM_PROFDATA` environment variables must be set to
            Clang/LLVM compatible with the LLVM version used in rustc.

        --no-cfg-coverage
            Unset cfg(coverage), which is enabled when code is built using cargo-llvm-cov

        --no-cfg-coverage-nightly
            Unset cfg(coverage_nightly), which is enabled when code is built using cargo-llvm-cov
            and nightly compiler

    -h, --help
            Print help information
